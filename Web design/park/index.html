      <h3>Who is April Ludgate?</h3>
      <p>April Roberta Ludgate-Dwyer, née Ludgate,[1] (portrayed by Aubrey Plaza) is a fictional character in the NBC comedy Parks and Recreation.[2] She is first seen as an apathetic college student working as an intern in the Pawnee Department of Parks and Recreation, before being hired as Ron Swanson's assistant.

			<h3>Ron Swanson</h3>

        <h3>Who is Ron Swanson?</h3>
      <p>Ronald Ulysses Swanson is a fictional character portrayed by Nick Offerman from the situation comedy television series Parks and Recreation on NBC, created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. In the series, Ron is the director of the Parks and Recreation department of fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana, and the immediate superior of series protagonist Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). In demeanor, political philosophy and work ethic, Knope and Swanson are polar opposites: where Knope is sunny and outgoing, decidedly liberal and constantly working, Swanson is distant, and as a staunch libertarian, is a strong advocate for small government—stating his belief that government should be privatized—and therefore believes that the parks department should not even exist.</p>

<p>Ron, who has an extremely deadpan and stereotypical masculine personality, actively works to make government less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting, Lagavulin whisky,[2] breakfast foods, nautical literature, and sex. He hates and fears his ex-wives, both named Tammy, one of whom is played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.</p>

			<h3>Andy Dwyer</h3>
			<img src="chris.webp" alt="Andy">
        <h3>Who is Andy Dwyer?</h3>
      <p>Andrew Maxwell Dwyer KBE is a fictional character in the NBC comedy Parks and Recreation portrayed by Chris Pratt. Originally meant to be a temporary character, Andy was so likable that producers asked Pratt back as a series regular. He appears in the first season as Ann Perkins' (Rashida Jones) unemployed, slacker boyfriend, then takes a job as a shoe-shiner at Pawnee City Hall in the second season. Andy eventually marries April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) and is later promoted to Leslie Knope's (Amy Poehler) assistant. Pratt was credited as a guest star for the first season, despite appearing in every episode; he is part of the main cast for every season after season one.</p>

<p>Andy is one of the few starring characters not to appear in every episode, as he was absent for a multi-episode arc in season six while Pratt was filming Guardians of the Galaxy. He also did not appear in the season 2 episode "Practice Date."</p>
